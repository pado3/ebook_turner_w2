BLE ebook page turner with CircuitPython & Seeed XIAO nRF52840 Sense

This is a project for turning forward/backward page and back to bookshelf of ebook application through BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). I confirmed its operation with SONY Reader, Kindle, Kinoppy, BOOK WALKER, Booklive, 読書尚友, なろうリーダ, which are all Android apps. This project is made with CircuitPython on Seeed XIAO nRF52840 Sense.
